# Denavitâ€“Hartenberg OpenGL 3D Visualization
New files in DH1 directory

This is a 3D visualisation of a robot defined by Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters. This program draws it on the screen, and you can control individual joints by pressing keys on your keyboard. XYZ end effector position is conveniently displayed in the console output.
It can be a good way to verify if your input data for a robot actually works as you expected and the robot defined by DH params actually looks like your real life robot.

To run this simulation, if you know nothing about OpenGL and have never run a single C++ program in Windows:

(1) Follow the attached PDF guide completely until you can draw a test triangle
(1.1) Do not forget to add the folder C:\mingw64\x86_64-w64-mingw32 to your system PATH environment variable. Not USER, SYSTEM!
(1.2) You will need to install both glut and glew libraries, don't skip that

(2) Open Command prompt or Powershell AS ADMIN and go to the directory where this file and main.cpp is:
cd C:\mingw64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\DH1

(3) Run the following command:

 g++ main.cpp -o DH1  -lopengl32  -lglu32 -lgdi32

It will create an EXE file which you can run and control the robot with your keyboard.
The compiler will give you some errors like this:
 warning: control reaches end of non-void function [-Wreturn-type]
Don't worry, these do not prevent you from successful compiling.

Joint number: key for positive direction, key for negative direction. Do not press "+" or "-"
